# localhostDeploy

Deploying the localhost to the web.

In terms of reliability,

1. [ngrok](./ngrok) [Restricted service for free users]
1. [localtunnel](./localtunnel) [Free]

Pick any one. localtunnel has a nice bonus of setting a webname but the service is unrealiable and prone to infinite crashes.
